# MMM-For-Dummies
With ExpressMMM, you can run a media mix model in just a few clicks ‚Äî no coding or statistical expertise required. Just bring your data!

## How It Works
1. Go to the ExpressMMM Website
https://expressmmm.streamlit.app/

Simply upload your dataset to get started. For demonstration purposes, I‚Äôm using a sample dataset that I generated to showcase how the model works.

2. Choose your variables
   
Select the variables you want to include in your model. In this example, I am selecting four marketing channels along with two control variables. To ensure accurate budget allocation, you must include at least one control variable.

Step 3: Sit Back and Analyze Your Model üòÅ
Once the model has finished training, you‚Äôll receive a detailed output showcasing the results. Here‚Äôs what the final output should look like:

- Model Accuracy (R2)

- Spend vs Effect

I‚Äôve also included a table for a structured view of the results ‚Äî perfect for those who prefer raw data over visualizations (though I must say, the visualizations are crafted with great care!).
